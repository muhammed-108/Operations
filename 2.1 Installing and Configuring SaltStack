2.1.1 Installing salt-master and salt-minion
Step 1 Configure a Yum repository.
Log in to all hosts (192.168.1.60 is called SaltStack) and run the following commands to
configure the Yum repository required by SaltStack:
rpm --import https://repo.saltproject.io/salt/py3/redhat/8/x86_64/latest/SALTSTACK-GPG-KEY.pub
curl -fsSL https://repo.saltproject.io/salt/py3/redhat/8/x86_64/latest.repo | sudo tee
/etc/yum.repos.d/salt.repo
The following figure shows the details

Step 2 Install salt-master.
Run the following command to install salt-master on the host SaltStack:
yum install salt-master -y

The following figure shows an example.

After the installation is complete, run the following command to start salt-master and set
it to start upon system startup:
systemctl enable salt-master --now


Run the following command to install salt-ssh. The Zabbix host is managed using SSH,
and the Nginx1 and Nginx2 hosts are managed using salt-minion.
yum install salt-ssh -y


Step 3 Configure salt-master.
Create the master.conf file in the /etc/salt/master.d directory on the host SaltStack and
enter the following content:
interface: 0.0.0.0
publish_port: 4505
ret_port: 4506
pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki/master
file_roots:
 base:
 - /srv/salt/
pillar_roots:
 base:
 - /srv/pillar
Restart the salt-master service and check the service status. If any error occurs, rectify the
fault before proceeding to the next step.


Step 4 Install salt-minion.
On Nginx1 and Nginx2, run the following command to install salt-minion:
yum install salt-minion -y
The following figure shows an example.


After the installation is complete, run the following command to start salt-minion and set
it to start upon system startup:
systemctl enable salt-minion --now



Step 5 Configure salt-minion.
Create the minion.conf file in the /etc/salt/minion.d directory on the host Nginx1 and
enter the following content:
master: 192.168.1.60
id: Nginx1

Create the minion.conf file in the /etc/salt/minion.d directory on the host Nginx2 and
enter the following content:
master: 192.168.1.60
id: Nginx2
After the configuration is complete, restart the salt-minion service on the two hosts and
ensure that the service is running properly.

2.1.2 Configuring the Master and Minion Authentication
Run the salt-key command on the master node to check whether the public key sent by
the minion is received. If the public key is received, the following informa is displayed:


Run the salt-key -A command to receive all keys. The details are as follows:


After the keys are received, run the following command to check whether the
communication between the master and minion is normal:
salt "*" test.ping
If the communication is normal, the following information is displayed:
